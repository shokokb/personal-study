# Personal Study Repository

This repository contains my personal study materials and coding practice aimed at strengthening my software engineering skills, particularly for technical interviews with leading tech companies.

## Overview

I use this repository as a central place to consolidate:

- Algorithm and data structure problems solved in Python  
- Coding exercises aligned with well-known learning resources  
- Notes on system design and software engineering best practices  
- Practice questions and sample solutions for coding interviews  
- Reflections on learning progress and insights gained  

## Structure

- `/algorithms` — Implementations of common algorithmic problems and patterns  
- `/design` — Notes and diagrams on system design concepts  
- `/practice` — Coding exercises from books and online platforms  
- `/notes` — Written reflections, study plans, and technical explanations  

## Goals

- Deepen understanding of algorithms and data structures through consistent coding practice  
- Improve problem-solving speed and code readability  
- Gain familiarity with common interview topics and question formats  
- Develop a disciplined study habit and track progress over time  

## Usage

Feel free to browse the code and notes for reference or inspiration. Contributions and feedback are welcome to help improve the quality and clarity of this study repository.
